jassijs - A Typescript Web Framework
====================================

With jassijs you can rapidly develop web apps. 
Write Typescript code in the browser, save and the code is hot reloaded in the browser.
There is a wysiwyg form editor, a report editor and a database designer.

The server runs in nodes (e.g. on Heroku with connecting this main repos and add postgres)  
or completly in the browser.

The Stage of development is Pre-alpha - it should not be used in production.
But you could have a preview (https://uwei.github.io/jassijs/dist/sample/app.html).
